A modular, multi-agent based system for PyTorch, Hugging Face, and AWS, powered by Anthropic's Claude family of models.

> **Note**: This project is compatible with GitHub Copilot through `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, which references the same agent architecture defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Philosophy

This repository embodies an **agent-based architecture** for machine learning projects, where specialized AI agents collaborate to deliver comprehensive solutions. Each agent maintains deep expertise in their domain while remaining modality and task agnostic.

## Core Principles

## Skill Progression Platform

This template serves as a gateway to two critical ML engineering competencies:

### PyTorch Mastery
Progress from basic tensor operations to production-ready ML systems through practical, agent-guided development. The `prompting-guide/` provides a structured path from prompt dependency to independent PyTorch expertise.

### Agentic Application Development
The multi-agent architecture here provides hands-on experience with patterns directly applicable to:
- **LangChain**: Chain-of-thought reasoning, tool use, and agent orchestration
- **AWS Bedrock Agents**: Structured prompts, knowledge bases, and action groups
- **NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails**: Agent safety, structured outputs, and conversation flows

By working with this template's agent team, you're learning:
- Agent coordination patterns (supervisor/worker models)
- Tool use and function calling (ReAct patterns)
- Structured prompting (INVEST+CRPG framework)
- Multi-agent orchestration (parallel and sequential workflows)

These skills transfer directly to building production agent applications, making this template both a PyTorch learning tool and an introduction to the agentic AI ecosystem.

## Structured Requirements Format

This project uses a disciplined approach to requirements specification:

### INVEST User Stories
All agent tasks and prompt templates follow the agile INVEST criteria

- **Independent** - Each story stands alone
- **Negotiable** - Flexible implementation details
- **Valuable** - Clear business or research value
- **Estimable** - Measurable scope and effort
- **Small** - Completable in reasonable time
- **Testable** - Verifiable success criteria

### CRPG Optimization Framework
A custom format using Reinforcement Learning language guides AI agent optimization

- **Constraints** - Technical boundaries and limitations
- **Rewards** - Success metrics and performance targets
- **Penalties** - Anti-patterns and quality deductions
- **Goal State** - Clear deliverables and validation criteria

This structured approach ensures agents understand both the "what" (user story) and the "how" (optimization parameters) of each task.

## Getting Started

1. **Define Your Project**: Consult `CLAUDE.md` to engage the Supervisor
2. **Select Your Team**: Claude routes to appropriate specialist agents
3. **Iterate and Build**: Agents collaborate to implement your solution

## Using Claude Code Agents

> View all available agents and their capabilities in [.claude/team.md](.claude/team.md)

### Basic Agent Invocation

In the Claude Code terminal, you can directly invoke specialized agents using `@agent-[NAME]` or let Claude automatically route your request to the appropriate expert.

#### Direct Agent Routing
```bash
# Explicitly call a specific agent using @agent-[NAME]
$ "@agent-NetworkArchitect implement a custom attention mechanism for video understanding"

# Agent responds with expertise
NetworkArchitect: I'll design a custom spatio-temporal attention module...
```

#### Automatic Routing
```bash
# Describe your task and Claude routes to appropriate agents
$ "I need to fine-tune a BERT model on my custom dataset with limited GPU memory"

# Claude automatically engages relevant agents
Supervisor: Let me establish your constraints...
TestArchitect: Writing tests for your fine-tuning pipeline...
ModelArchitect: Selecting optimal BERT variant for your memory constraints...
DataEngineer: Configuring efficient data loading...
```

### Common Workflows

#### Starting a New Project
```bash
$ "I want to build an image classification system for medical X-rays"

# Supervisor coordinates the team
Supervisor: Analyzing requirements...
DomainExpert: Medical imaging requires specific preprocessing...
DatasetCurator: Searching for relevant medical datasets...
TestArchitect: Writing comprehensive test suite first...
NetworkArchitect: Designing architecture for medical images...
```

#### Fine-tuning with Limited Resources
```bash
$ "Fine-tune Llama-2-7B on my customer support dataset using QLoRA"

# Specialized agents collaborate
ModelArchitect: Configuring Llama-2-7B with 4-bit quantization...
DataEngineer: Setting up efficient data pipeline...
TrainingOrchestrator: Implementing QLoRA with gradient checkpointing...
MetricsArchitect: Establishing evaluation metrics...
```

#### Local Testing Before Deployment
```bash
$ "Test my model API locally before deploying to AWS"

# LocalStackEmulator coordinates with CloudEngineer
LocalStackEmulator: Starting local AWS environment...
CloudEngineer: Configuring API endpoints for local testing...
TestArchitect: Running integration tests against LocalStack...
```

#### Creating Test-Driven ML Code
```bash
$ "Write tests for a vision transformer training pipeline"

# TestArchitect leads TDD workflow
TestArchitect: Creating tests that will fail initially...
  - test_model_initialization()
  - test_forward_pass_shapes()
  - test_loss_computation()
  - test_optimizer_step()
NetworkArchitect: Implementing ViT to pass your tests...
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Example

```bash
$ "Deploy a real-time object detection API with <50ms latency"

# Watch agents collaborate
Supervisor: Establishing latency requirements...
TestArchitect: Writing performance benchmarks...
ModelArchitect: Selecting YOLOv8n for speed...
ComputeOrchestrator: Recommending g5.xlarge instance...
CloudEngineer: Implementing FastAPI with async inference...
LocalStackEmulator: Testing locally first...
InterfaceDesigner: Creating monitoring dashboard...

# Result: Complete deployment pipeline with tests
```

### Tips for Effective Agent Use

1. **Be Specific**: Include constraints, metrics, and requirements
2. **Direct Invocation**: Use `@agent-[NAME]` to call specific agents
3. **Use Templates**: Copy prompts from `prompt-templates/` for consistency
4. **Test First**: Let TestArchitect write tests before implementation
5. **Local First**: Use LocalStackEmulator before AWS deployment
6. **Trust Routing**: Claude knows which agents to engage when not specified

### Agent Coordination Patterns

```bash
# Iterative workflow
$ "Test → Data → Model → Training → Deploy (continuous iteration)"

# Parallel execution
$ "Run tests AND start LocalStack AND prepare dataset"

# Specific expertise request
$ "@agent-MetricsArchitect design custom metrics for video quality assessment"
```

## Design Principles

### Non-Package Architecture
The `src/` directory contains standalone modules that can be run directly without package installation. This simplifies deployment and reduces complexity while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

### Agile Development Process
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Documented technical decisions in `docs/adr/`
- **Sprint Tracking**: Comprehensive sprint planning and retrospectives in `docs/sprints/`
- **Test-Driven Development**: TestArchitect enforces TDD practices
- **Continuous Integration**: Built into agent collaboration workflows

### Modern Tooling
- **uv**: Fast, reliable Python package management
- **Ruff**: Single tool for linting and formatting
- **Pre-commit**: Automated code quality checks
- **Type hints**: Full typing support throughout

This template provides the foundation for any ML project, from research prototypes to production systems.
